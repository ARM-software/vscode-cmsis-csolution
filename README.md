# Arm CMSIS Solution

## Overview

The complete [documentation](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108029/latest/Extension-pack-and-extensions) for Arm® CMSIS Solution and the other Keil® Studio extensions is available on Arm Developer.

The Arm CMSIS Solution extension provides support for working with CMSIS solutions (csolution projects). You can install it individually or as part of the Arm Keil Studio Pack extension in Visual Studio Code Desktop.

We recommend installing the [Keil Studio Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.keil-studio-pack) for Visual Studio Code Desktop to quickly set up your environment. You can then [import a solution example from keil.arm.com](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108029/latest/Get-started-with-an-example-project/Import-a-solution-example), [download a μVision project from keil.arm.com](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108029/latest/Get-started-with-an-example-project/Download-a-Keil--Vision-example), [create a solution from scratch](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108029/latest/Arm-CMSIS-Solution-extension/Create-a-solution), or [convert an existing μVision project](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108029/latest/Arm-CMSIS-Solution-extension/Convert-a-Keil--Vision-project-to-a-solution).

The CMSIS Solution extension works with the Arm Device Manager (Identifier: `arm.device-manager`) and Arm Debugger (Identifier: `arm.arm-debugger`) extensions.
