# Arm CMSIS csolution

## Overview

The complete [documentation](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108029/latest/Extension-pack-and-extensions) for **Arm CMSIS csolution** and the other Keil Studio extensions is available on Arm Developer.

The **Arm CMSIS csolution** extension provides support for working with CMSIS solutions (csolution projects). It can be installed individually or together with other extensions contained in the pack available for Visual Studio Code Desktop. 

We recommend installing the **Keil Studio Pack** for Visual Studio Code Desktop to quickly set up your environment and start working with an example.

The **Arm CMSIS csolution** extension can work with the **Arm Device Manager** (Identifier: `arm.device-manager`) and **Arm Embedded Debugger** (Identifier: `arm.embedded-debug`) extensions.

## Intended use cases for the extensions

- **Embedded and IoT software development using CMSIS-Packs and csolution projects**: The "Common Microcontroller Software Interface Standard" (CMSIS) provides driver, peripheral and middleware support for thousands of MCUs and hundreds of development boards. Using the csolution project format, you can incorporate any CMSIS-Pack based device, board, and software component into your application. For more information about supported hardware for CMSIS projects, go to the [Boards](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/) and [Devices](https://www.keil.arm.com/devices/) pages on keil.arm.com. For information about CMSIS-Packs, go to [open-cmsis-pack.org](https://www.open-cmsis-pack.org/index.html).

- **Enhancement of a pre-existing Visual Studio Code embedded software development workflow**: USB device management and embedded debug can be adapted to other project formats (for example CMake) and toolchains without additional overhead. This use case requires familiarity with Visual Studio Code to configure tasks. See the individual extensions for more details.
